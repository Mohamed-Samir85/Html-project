Digital life is augmenting human capacities and disrupting eons-old human activities.
Code-driven systems have spread to more than half of the world’s inhabitants in ambient
information and connectivity, offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats.
As emerging algorithm-driven artificial intelligence (AI) continues to spread,
will people be better off than they are today?

Some 979 technology pioneers, innovators, developers, business and policy leaders,
researchers and activists answered this question in a canvassing of experts conducted in the summer of 2018.


The experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human effectiveness but also threaten human autonomy,
agency and capabilities. They spoke of the wide-ranging possibilities;
that computers might match or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities on tasks such as complex decision-making,
reasoning and learning, sophisticated analytics and pattern recognition, visual acuity,
speech recognition and language translation. They said “smart” systems in communities, in vehicles,
in buildings and utilities, on farms and in business processes will save time,
money and lives and offer opportunities for individuals to enjoy a more-customized future.
